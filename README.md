Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository! This project is built using **Next.js** and **Chakra UI**, designed to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects. It features a responsive layout with a modern and minimalistic UI/UX. The website also includes a blog section where I share insights on software development, design, finance, and more.

## ‚ú® About Me

From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I knew I was stepping into a world of endless possibilities. **I am Karthik Kashyap R P**, a passionate **Software Developer** who believes that technology is not just about writing code but about solving real-world problems and making a tangible impact. My journey began with a curiosity to understand how things work, leading me to earn a **Bachelor‚Äôs in Information Science and Engineering** from **SJB Institute of Technology, Bangalore**.

Fueled by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I am currently pursuing a **Master‚Äôs in Computer Software Engineering** at **Northeastern University, Boston** (Expected May 2026). Over the years, my experiences at **Accenture** and other ventures have helped me craft scalable microservices, optimize high-performance database queries, and build innovative solutions in logistics and healthcare. Whether it's architecting resilient systems or automating workflows, I am driven by the pursuit of efficiency, innovation, and excellence.

Beyond the technical realm, I thrive in collaborative environments, constantly pushing boundaries to deliver exceptional software experiences. This portfolio is a reflection of my passion, my expertise, and my ever-growing journey in the world of technology.
